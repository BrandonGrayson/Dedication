## Overview
Welcome To Dedication. An app built and Dedicated to all those who Inspire Us to be the best version of ourselves. The closest thing I can thing to compare Dedication to Is Wikipedia. The Goal it to be able to highlight the Career and Accomplishments of a Person, Time period, Historical Event, TV Shows etc. There really is no limit to what type of Dedication pages can be built.

From a User perspective; The idea is for each page to be an experience. Currently the first dedication page is for Nipsey Hussle. A Musician out of Los Angeles, California. And to the concept of The Marathon Continues. I want a user to experience who Nipsey was his career, music, accomplishments, obstacles, family. 

From a dev perspective I'd like to expand this to anyone who'd like to contribute a page for something or someone that Inspired them on their jouney.
